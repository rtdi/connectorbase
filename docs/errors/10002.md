There are multiple implementations how to connect to the backend pipeline server, e.g. Kafka directly via TCP or via a http proxy. 
During the web application start the Java code 

    ServiceLoader.load(IPipelineAPI.class) 

tries to locate one and in this case it did many. This should not happen when building the web application.
see the WebApp's /WEB-INF/lib directory and also the web server's lib directory.

Another way to deal with this situation is to specify the "api" in the global.properties file.
